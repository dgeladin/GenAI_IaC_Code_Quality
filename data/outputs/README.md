# PhD Dissertation: Impact of GenAI on IaC Code Quality

This repository stores the outputs generated by various Generative AI models (GenAI) for evaluating their impact on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) code quality using Terraform. This research is part of a PhD dissertation.

## Project Goals

* Analyze the effectiveness of different GenAI models in generating high-quality Terraform code.
* Evaluate IaC code quality metrics using industry-standard tools like TFLint, TFSec, and Checkov.
* Compare and contrast the performance of different GenAI models for IaC code generation.

## Data Structure

The `outputs` directory contains subdirectories for each GenAI model used in the study. These subdirectories contain the generated Terraform code corresponding to 10 specific prompts defined in the [Prompt Section](../prompt/README.md).

**Directory Structure:**

* model_1/
  * prompt_1/
  * prompt_2/
  * ...

* model_2/
  * prompt_1/
  * prompt_2/
  * ...

## Model List:

* model_1: ChatGPT
* model_2: Google Gemini
* model_3: Anthropic Claude
* model_4: Github Copilot
* model_5: Code Llama
* model_6: Amazon Q Developer

## Accessing and Utilizing Outputs

Each file within the model subdirectories represents the Terraform code generated by the corresponding model for a specific prompt. These Terraform formatted outputs will be analyzed using IaC static code analysis tools: TFLint, TFSec, and Checkov.

## Further Resources

This repository serves as a data repository for the PhD dissertation research.
