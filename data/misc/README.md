# Misc Data

## Checkov
Checkov does not report the severity with the OOTB commandline tool. The severity is listed on the webpage listed in the output. For this project, I took the results of the static analysis, and looked up all the severities to allow the tools to calculate the weighted scores.

Update CHECKOV_ID_MAPPING.txt with any additional severity checks that are missing in the run.
